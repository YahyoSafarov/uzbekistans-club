				A young and progressive team working and gaining experience in the
				creative industry, media, and education for several years has
				implemented Uzbekistan's club project since 2021.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thousands of Uzbekistanis with great potential are making successful
				careers in large companies, authoritative organizations and educational
				institutions worldwide. Hundreds of compatriots have started their
				profitable businesses in foreign countries. This trend will continue due
				to the growth of our population and the development of private education
				in Uzbekistan, the desire of the young generation to work on themselves.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is such a unique opportunity - to take advantage of our demographic
				dividend, we:
			</p>

			<p>
				– launched the uzbekistans.club platform you are using, we created a
				chance for successful citizens to become a resident online;
			</p>

			<p>– released several inspiring episodes of Oʻzbekistonlik;</p>

			<p>
				– prepared a culinary show including the preparation of our national
				dishes and engaging conversations;
			</p>

			<p>
				– started the Aral Dream project to draw global attention to the Aral
				Sea problems;
			</p>

			<p>
				– founded international forums serving to develop ideas for the
				development of Uzbekistan and strengthen networking among compatriots;
			</p>

			<p>
				– created the club media residency for journalists, bloggers and
				influencers.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, the above is only the beginning of long-term projects. Our team
				support media initiatives, and events and works to rise human capital in
				Uzbekistan with our fellows. We invite Uzbekistanis who have made a
				successful career abroad or started their business to join the club as
				residents. Through Uzbekistan's club, our primary task is to familiarise
				our heroes with the people and connect compatriots from different parts
				of the world with each other.
